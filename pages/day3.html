    <p>let's use what we've learned to create functional forms and arbtirarily positioned elements.

contact me form
as i did in class, create a new html file in your pages folder. this file will be a custom "contact me" form
make sure to use the following input tag types:
text
password
date
radio
checkbox
make sure to try out some other input types, such as:
email
color
date
textarea
note: textarea is its own tag. it is not a type of input
make sure to include an input tag with a type="submit" attribute at the very end, otherwise you won't be able to send this form
hook your form up to formspree.io.  sadly, the form won't actually work until we get these sites hosted.
creating a navbar
much like i did in class, create a navbar that is fixed to the top of the screen
make sure the buttons in the navbar line up next to one another, rather than stacking.
hint: try the display:inline-block property
make each of these buttons clickable links that take you to other pages on your site
try sliding a made up "brand" image into the navbar. it should look something like this
bonus: try using pseudo-selectors and the transition property to make the individual navbar buttons highlight when the mouse hovers over them.</p>
